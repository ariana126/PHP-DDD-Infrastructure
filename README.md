# 🏗 PHP DDD Infrastructure

A lightweight **starter toolkit** for building Domain-Driven Design (DDD) applications in PHP.  
It provides base classes and patterns for **Entities**, **Value Objects**, **Aggregate Roots**, and **Domain Events**, plus optional helpers for **Doctrine ORM** and **Symfony**.

This is not a framework — it’s a **foundation** you can integrate into **any PHP project**, regardless of framework choice (Laravel, Symfony, Slim, or even vanilla PHP).
